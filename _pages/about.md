## Background

I am a software engineer with a lot of frontend experience using vanilla Javascript, Typescript, React, Angular, Ember, Svelte, and Vue. I've dabbled in many other general purpose languages too: C#, Java, Clojure, Elixir and Ruby. I enjoy experimenting with new tools/languages to learn everyday and I believe that teaching others to share in a love for learning is the most important aspect of any profession, but especially as a developer.

I strive to be a quick learner and both a competent leader and capable worker. In my free time I enjoy cycling, playing the tuba, hiking, reading, and spending time with family. I'd aim to contribute more to open source projects and have a few minor contributions to several major frontend libs: React, Redux, Angular, Underscore and Webpack.
