I got into Famo.us! I've been playing with it on and off today, and let me say that I really do think it's a game changer. It makes playing with physics in JS fun, and not that difficult to grasp. It definately takes the DOM and turns it on its head, which may be long overdue. Famo.us is the kind of company where I would love to work.
