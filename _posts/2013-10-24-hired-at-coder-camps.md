I've finished all the negotiation and I'm coming on board at Coder Camps to help as a developer and instructor. I'm looking forward to learning more on the job, and hope to help improve the experience for future campers.

I have jumped right in, and I'm trying to give the students right behind me as much help as I can. It definately takes a large amount of patience, but I think my experience teaching fourth graders has helped me develop a little patience. The best part of the job, is I get to teach and not worry about grading.
