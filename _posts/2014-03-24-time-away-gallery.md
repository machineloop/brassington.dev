It is critical to take time away from work. Time to relax and regroup. I can get completely swept up in the go-go-go bootcamp schedule, but I can't operate like that constantly with no end. Programmers have to get back to reality away from the demands of their consoles, their editors, their commits, and their keyboards. Back to real life, where the air is still, the trees reach for the sky, and you can escape. My wife and I took a long leisurely walk. We ate good food, and relaxed with family. Code now. But get away, take time away.
