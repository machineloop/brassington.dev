I've been flying so much recently that I'm getting sick. I had a flight with a 6-hour delay that kept me up all night. Flying every weekend doesn't really make as much sense as I thought it would. 

When I committed to the job in Houston, I knew it would be hard flying back and forth all the time to see my wife. Little did I know that it would take me out for a day here and there. I was so wiped out, I ended up missing a few days of work. If I could stay a little longer on either side of the weekends I do go home, I could make up for it.

So, I've got to make it work, and fly a little less often.
