At last, Microsoft is coming around. Open Source produces better code and makes it easier for developers to share their code instead of obsessing over proprietary code bases.

Of course there will always be a need for proprietary code, but keep it minimal, and certainly don't hold on to it for years if you build products that millions of people need to used on a daily basis. There's no way you can hire a development team larger than your userbase: plain and simple.

Finally, Microsoft is turning the corner, but what about all the development shops they've taught to be overprotective of their source code?
