I've been playing with Famous, the new open source javascript framework which is extremely performant and all written in JavaScript. In my novice opinion, Famous is a dream come true for JS developers. 

Famous takes JS calls and turns them into DOM elements and manages them all for you. No more making calls to DOM elements which must already exist on the page: Famous will do it for you. 

I can't tell you how many times I've thought it was cumbersome to teach my students to inject HTML into a page using string concatenation or some other clumsy method. They have to wrap their minds around when and where their DOM elements exist in the tree.

Famous manages this complexity for you, and the payoffs are huge! You get great positioning, manipulation of styles using JSON objects, transitions, animation, tweening, and physics all in native JS!

I can't wait to learn more! Famous will be famous among JS developers.
