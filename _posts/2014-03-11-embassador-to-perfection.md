You can never write perfect code, but your PC expects nothing less. Learning how to program is learning how to be an embassador to perfection.

I always say this to my students because I believe it helps ease the transition into dealing with errors and setbacks constructively. We're trained in school to never make mistakes, but in programming, that's how you progress.
